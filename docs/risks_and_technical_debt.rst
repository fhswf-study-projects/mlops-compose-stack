11. Risks and Technical Debt
============================

This section describes Risks and technical debts of this project.

============
11.1 Risks
============

Potential challenges that could impact system reliability, security, or performance.

- **Infrastructure Downtime** – Service disruptions due to server failures or misconfigurations.
- **Scalability Bottlenecks** – System may struggle to handle increased load without optimized scaling.
- **Security Vulnerabilities** – Risk of data breaches if access control and encryption are misconfigured.
- **Data Consistency Issues** – Risk of inconsistencies due to distributed storage and processing.
- **Dependency Management** – Outdated or unsupported dependencies could lead to security risks.
- **Monitoring and Alerts** – Inadequate observability may delay issue detection and resolution.
- **Regulatory Compliance** – Failure to comply with GDPR or other regulations may lead to penalties.

11.2 Technical Debt
=======================

Areas where quick solutions may lead to long-term maintenance challenges.

- **Hardcoded Configurations** – Some services may have environment variables hardcoded, reducing flexibility.
- **Manual Deployment Steps** – Certain updates may still require manual intervention instead of full automation.
- **Components** – Some components are tightly coupled, limiting modularity and scalability.
- **Incomplete Test Coverage** – Automated testing is not yet comprehensive, increasing the risk of undetected bugs.
- **Performance Inefficiencies** – Certain queries or processing steps are not optimized, affecting response times.
- **Lack of Documentation** – Some internal processes and API endpoints lack proper documentation, slowing onboarding.
